# Introduction
user Authorization is the most important part in any modern web sites, web app or even a tiny web module.
the time we develop SSA website we gave mojor concentration in authorization. This website holds multilevel, like a hierarchy of users,with different access properties. A school user cannot login and see another school's details. likewise, a block user will not gonna access another block's information. this is the basic thing we had done. As the above, state admin and state user are two different users and they both are two different access level. we implemented this to every acess level of users.
